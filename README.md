# polymer_blend_morphology
Applying ML to study simulated polymer blend morphology

## Dataset

The images generated during the simulations carried out as part of the study are found in the `Images` directory. The filename e.g. `image_0002.png` captures the run ID (`0002`). The input parameters and cluster labels for that specific run ID can be found in `Clustering Results.csv`. 

The dataset also contains the extracted Red, Green, Blue (RGB) channels of the original image. `image_*_0` corresponds to Blues, `image_*_1` corresponds to Greens and `image_*_2` corresponds to Reds.
